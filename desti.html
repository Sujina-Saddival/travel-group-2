                I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.<br/><br/>

                When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth.<br/><br/>

                A thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath.</p>

              <h1>Why Mexico And Things To Do</h1> 
              <p style="width:768px;">Mexico is one of the year’s hottest destinations, what with its secret island escapes, Caribbean coastline and cosmopolitan capital city, as well as its thriving restaurant scene and quirky colonial towns that are ideal for day trips.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p id="Showpara3">Mexico is a country of delicious food, that much is clear, but it’s not all tacos and tortas. In fact, the culinary scene from north to south varies wildly, although each dish remains just as delicious as the last. Whether you want carne asada or cabrito in the north, seafood on the Pacific coast in Sinaloa, hangover busting tortas ahogadas in western Jalisco or Mayan delicacies in the Yucatán Peninsula, one thing’s for sure – you’ll never be short of options.
              Even though clubs in Mexico tend to blast out the tracks that are doing the rounds internationally, whether in Spanish or English, the traditional music of the country is diverse, excellent and shouldn’t be overlooked.<br/><br/>

              From the emblematic mariachi groups, to the bands that blast out banda or son Jarochos, live Mexican music is far more varied than people often give it credit for, and often much better than the headline-stealing Justin Bieber remixes of reggaeton hits.

              <h1>Weekend For Two In Venice</h1> 
              <p>Venice never loses its capacity to enchant. There is a reason why they come: the sheer loveliness of an exquisite city that seems miraculously built on water.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p id="Showpara5">The wondrous, mosaic-studded interior of Venice’s mother church, St Mark’s Basilica (basilicasanmarco.it; free) doesn’t open to casual visitors until 9.45am, but anyone is welcome to attend morning mass. Take your pick between the 7am, 8am and 9am slots. The advantage of the latter, apart from the lie-in, is that it’s a sung Lauds mass, and there’s nothing like plainsong to bring out the magic of St Mark’s. Afterwards, visit the Museum of St Mark’s (€4).<br/><br/>

              Walk back along the scenic Riva degli Schiavoni waterfront promenade and hop on the number 2 vaporetto (waterbus) at the San Marco - San Zaccaria stop. Get off at the next stop, the island of San Giorgio Maggiore (0039 041 220 1215; cini.it), and take the lift to the top of the 18th-century campanile to enjoy a view I prefer to the one from the bell tower of St Mark’s, as it gives one a much better idea of Venice as a series of islands in the lagoon.</p>

But perhaps it would surprise you to hear that although we all know Big Ben – this massive clock tower is actually officially named something completely different! Read on for some fascinating facts about this most beloved of London’s landmarks and learn how some of you can tour Big Ben official tours suspended until 2021.<br/><br/>
              Although Big Ben has been praised throughout its’ history for accurately keeping time throughout the decades – including during the Blitz in WWII – the chimes have been silenced on occasion, a few examples of which follow:
              During WWI the clock was silenced for two years, and the clock dials were darkened, to prevent detection by German zeppelin craft.
